# Classical Language Toolkit
Zachary Shuda
## Introduction
Classical languages are languages that are not spoken today but have a large amount of written works. Since many classical languages are earlier forms of modern languages, classical languages usually have different grammar, syntax, and phonology. CLTK offers the ability to tag a variety of classical languages for parts of speech and phonetics.
## Offered languages
CLTK uses 3 letter strings to refer to a language within the code.
| Language  | Code |
