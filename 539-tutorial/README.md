# Classical Language Toolkit
Zachary Shuda
## Introduction
Classical languages are languages that have a large amount of written works that date to an earlier time. Since many classical languages are earlier forms of modern languages, classical languages usually have different grammar, syntax, and phonology. CLTK offers the ability to tag a variety of classical languages for parts of speech and phonetics.
